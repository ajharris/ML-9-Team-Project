# ML-9 Team Project

Stroke prediction dataset is selected (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)

# Purpose & Overview

Stroke, a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, places a significant burden on healthcare systems. In fact, yearly stroke-realted health care costs in Ontario, Canada were estimated to be up to $40,000 as of 2018 [1] which has likely only increased since then. Early prediction and intervention are therefore crucial to reducing mortality, improving patient outcome and reducing the costs on the health care system. Maching learning approaches offer promising tools for enhancing stroke prediction by analyzing vast datasets to identify patterns and risk factors that traditional methods may overlook.

# Goals & Objectives

Machine learning models (ML) including Random Forests and Deep Learning (DL) models like Convolutional Neural Networks have been successfully used previously for stroke prevention [2,3]. The goals of the current project are to explore ML and DL models using a diverse and large-scale dataset to predict the occurrence of stroke while achieving high sensitivity and specificity.

The specific objectives of the project include:
1. 
2.
3.

# Techniques & Technologies

# Key Findings & Setup Instructions

After reviewing several datasets, we have decided to investigate the Stroke Prediction one. We are investigating whether a difference can be found by ML between male and female subjects.

## Possible Questions:

Are there different risk factors per age group, which would indicate different prevention strategies?

BMI, Age, Rural/Urban, see if there's different risk factors/prevention for different groups


## Approaches:
Regression to find composition and correlation of different variables

Based on significance of variables, create a model to predict stroke or not

## Possible Problem:
The occurance of stroke overwhelms the lack of stroke by an order of magnitude.
